Task: To scrape the entire data (without using Selenium, instead BeautifulSoup) from the table of Field brown dwarfs from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brown_dwarfs, create a dataframe using pandas, and write to a .csv file.

The .csv file attached is auto-generated by the program; it is a demo.
